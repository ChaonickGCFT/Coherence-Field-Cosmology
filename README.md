## 🌌 Abstract
This repository contains the full paper and LaTeX source for *Coherence Field Cosmology*, a proposed theoretical replacement for the ΛCDM model. By modeling mass, gravity, time, and redshift as emergent properties of a single coherence field Ξ, this framework unifies key aspects of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

I'm developing the **General Coherence Field Theory (GCFT)** — a unifying model of mass, space, gravity, and quantum behavior grounded in a single coherence field, Ξ.
